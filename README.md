# CIS7-Project
This project solves a case of determining the shortest and cheapest path in a given scenario. 

**Case #1:**
A solar marketing specialist travels from Riverside to Moreno Valley, then to Perris and Hemet to market solar packages to homeowners. The travel route is shown below:
{"Perris", "Riverside", 24}, {"Perris","Moreno", 18}, {"Perris", "Hemet", 30}, {"Riverside", "Perris", 24}, {"Riverside", "Moreno", 16}, {"Riverside", "Hemet", 33}, {"Hemet", "Riverside", 33}, {"Hemet", "Moreno", 26}, {"Hemet", "Perris", 30}};

If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products.
Determine the shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist.
Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, low-cost and shortest paths, including matrices, and adjacencies.
